#Semester-7 BTP

This project includes the code for generating 3-phase pairs of PWM signals.\
The concept uses a lookup table for the values to be loaded in the compare register of the PWM Module.\
The board used is: TMS320F2837xD (TI Launchpad C2000)\

###Contents:
-> Code: Source code and required header files\
-> Presentation(ppt file in pdf format)\
-> Reference for ePWM\ 
-> Result_Waveforms: Resultant Waveforms taken(for different R loads) after the amplified 3-phase PWM signals are passed through a 3-phase inverter and then a 3-phase resistor load.
