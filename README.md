#Semester-7 BTP

This project includes the code for generating 3-phase pairs of PWM signals.<br>
The concept uses a lookup table for the values to be loaded in the compare register of the PWM Module.<br>
The board used is: TMS320F2837xD (TI Launchpad C2000).<br>

###Contents:
-> Code: Source code and required header files.<br>
-> Presentation(ppt file in pdf format).<br>
-> Reference for ePWM.<br>
-> Result_Waveforms: Resultant Waveforms taken(for different R loads) after the amplified 3-phase PWM signals are passed through a 3-phase inverter and then a 3-phase resistor load.
